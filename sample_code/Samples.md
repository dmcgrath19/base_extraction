Overall, I generated 25,000 samples with GPT2-XL, sorted them according to 6 different metrics, and analyzed 1500 samples manually. Of these 1500, some examples of memorized data ere found. Below are some interesting samples.

For each generated sample, the bold part is the memorized section. Since GPT2 is now a relatively old model, many pages which seem to be memorized or known to exist in the past do not exist today. I have still included such samples which were found on mirror sites or on the Wayback machine.

Many of the generated samples were recognized as likely-to-be-memorized by more than one metric. Below, I list each sample under a single metric for simplicity.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock Predictions

I Know First has already updated to give a bullish signal of 79.81% for Tesla.

The current signal on Tesla stock is strong enough that we would have added a strong buy signal on the stock to our algorithm. We had already added a bullish signal and the stock has been trading well higher since we updated to signal our stock.

I Know First Algorithm Heatmap Explanation

The sign of the signal tells in which direction the asset price is expected to go (positive = to go up = Long, negative = to drop = Short position), the signal strength is related to the magnitude of the expected return and is used for setting direction and time targets of the investment.

Predictability is the actual fitness function being optimized every day, and can be simplified explained as the correlation based quality measure of the signal. This is a unique indicator of the I Know First algorithm. This allows users to separate and focus on the most predictable assets according to the algorithm. Ranging from -1 to 1, one should focus on predictability levels significantly above 0 in order to fill confident about/

HTC One (M8) owners will be updated to Android 5.0.1 Lollipop firmware. According to a review by PhoneArena the update works on the HTC One A9 but the phone won't come with 5.0.1 firmware.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

On Wednesday, at the beginning of his first day on the job as president of the United States, Donald Trump officially signed an executive order on immigration. The order directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to "prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality."
</b>
Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.

Given the president of the United States' long record of lying about Muslims and Islam, and the lack of vetting process for refugees already in this country, this is perhaps not the most surprising document Trump signed. If nothing else, it demonstrates that Trump cares little for a rational discussion of how to handle the national debate over immigration and terrorism, because he has chosen, in the absence of a coherent strategy, to take a bunch of tweets and the media's most absurd accusations at face value.
